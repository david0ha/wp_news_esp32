Serve a REAL Obsidian vault to the board.

`mock_vault_server.py` is the contract as a fixed payload — it pins the wire
format and produces the test fixture. This is the other half: it walks an actual
vault on disk, works out the same numbers from the notes that are really there,
and serves them at the same URL shape. Point the board at this and the panel
stops showing a demo and starts showing your vault.

    python3 tools/vault_server.py ~/Documents/MyVault
    curl -X POST http://obsidianboard.local/api/vault \\
         -d '{"url":"http://mymac.local:8123/vault.json"}'

Read-only by default: it opens `.md` files and nothing else. `--allow-capture`
adds one write path, `POST /capture`, which appends a memo to the vault's inbox
so the board's queue is somewhere you can actually put things — see "Capture"
below. It stays off unless you ask for it.

What the numbers mean
---------------------
The definitions are Obsidian's where Obsidian has one, and stated here where it
does not — the board has no room to explain itself, so this is where the meaning
lives.

- **notes**     every `.md` file under the vault, excluding dotted directories
                (`.obsidian`, `.trash`, `.git`) and anything `--exclude`d.
- **links**     distinct **directed** pairs (A links to B) where both ends are
                notes that exist. Two `[[B]]`s in A count once; a link to a note
                that has not been created yet counts zero, because the graph on
                the panel has nowhere to draw it. `![[embeds]]` count.
- **orphans**   notes with no links in *or* out — Obsidian's own definition.
- **tags**      distinct tags, from frontmatter `tags:` and from inline `#tag`.
                Code fences and inline code are stripped first, so a `#include`
                in a C snippet is not a tag.
- **added**     by creation date: a `created:` frontmatter field if there is one
                and it parses, else the filesystem's birth time (macOS), else
                mtime. `daily` is the last seven days, oldest first.
- **recent**    the eight most recently *modified* notes.
- **inbox**     notes under an inbox folder (`--inbox`, auto-detected by default)
                or carrying `--inbox-tag`. Oldest first: the point of the list is
                what has been sitting there longest.
- **agents**    read from a JSON file that something else writes; see --agents.
                No file, no agents — this server does not invent them.

Rescanning is incremental: a file whose mtime and size are unchanged is not
reopened. A 3,000-note vault costs a second the first time and milliseconds
after that, which matters because the board polls forever.

Capture
-------
A wall display showing an inbox you cannot add to is half a loop. With
`--allow-capture`, one endpoint closes it:

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8123/capture -d 'ring the dentist'

That writes `Inbox/ring the dentist.md` into the vault, and the board shows it
on its next poll. Bind it to a keyboard shortcut and the board becomes somewhere
to put things, not just somewhere to look.

It is off by default and has to be asked for, because it writes into somebody's
notes and this is an unauthenticated service on a LAN. When it is on, it can do
exactly one thing: create a new `.md` file inside the capture folder. The
filename is built here from a sanitised slug, so a request cannot name a path;
an existing file is never overwritten; and the body is capped.

Usage
-----
    python3 tools/vault_server.py VAULT                  # serve on :8123
    python3 tools/vault_server.py VAULT --port 9000
    python3 tools/vault_server.py VAULT --dump           # print the payload
    python3 tools/vault_server.py VAULT --inbox Inbox --inbox-tag '#todo'
    python3 tools/vault_server.py VAULT --agents ~/agents.json
    python3 tools/vault_server.py VAULT --allow-capture  # enable POST /capture
