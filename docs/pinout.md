# Pinout

The board is a **Seeed XIAO ePaper Display Board EE04** carrying a **XIAO ESP32-S3 Plus**; the
5.83" panel plugs into the EE04's 24-pin FPC connector. These are the carrier's fixed routing, not
defaults — but they still live in one place, `main/user_config.h`, and nothing else in the firmware
hardcodes a GPIO. Even the buttons are passed to `user_app` as data, for the same reason
`epd_init()` takes the panel's pins.

## e-Paper (UC8179, 648 × 480, via the EE04 FPC)

| EE04 net | XIAO pad | GPIO | `user_config.h` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SPI0_MOSI | D10 | 9 | `EPD_MOSI_PIN` | SPI MOSI |
| SPI0_SCL | D8 | 7 | `EPD_SCK_PIN` | SPI SCLK, 10 MHz |
| SPI0_CS | D7 | 44 | `EPD_CS_PIN` | driven by `esp_lcd` |
| EDP_DC | D16 | 10 | `EPD_DC_PIN` | driven by `esp_lcd` |
| EDP_RES | D11 | 38 | `EPD_RST_PIN` | output |
| EDP_BUSY | D3 | 4 | `EPD_BUSY_PIN` | **input, active LOW while refreshing** |
| PWR_EN | D6 | 43 | `EPD_POWER_PIN` | **panel power gate, active HIGH** |

SPI host is `SPI3_HOST`. MISO is unused (`-1`).

These are transcribed from Seeed's own library rather than measured or inferred — see
[`Seeed_GFX/User_Setups/EPaper_Board_Pins_Setups.h`](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_GFX/blob/master/User_Setups/EPaper_Board_Pins_Setups.h),
the `USE_XIAO_EPAPER_DISPLAY_BOARD_EE04` branch. It is byte-identical to the EE05 branch, which is
why this fork inherited the display wiring unchanged from the board it came from.

Three traps, all fatal to the display if ignored:

- **BUSY is active LOW on the UC8179** — the panel is idle when the pin is HIGH. That is the exact
  inverse of the SSD1680 this codebase's driver started as, and getting it backwards does not fail
  loudly: every wait returns immediately and every refresh comes out torn. The driver also issues
  `0x71` (GET STATUS) before each sample, because the controller refreshes its BUSY output on that
  command and polling the pin alone can sit on a stale level.
- **PWR_EN gates the panel's 3.3V** through a load switch with a pulldown on its enable. The panel
  is unpowered until GPIO43 is driven HIGH — `epd_init()` does this before the first reset and
  leaves it on (cutting power would wipe the previous-image plane that partial refreshes diff
  against).
- **GPIO43/44 are the ESP32-S3's default UART0 pins.** The console therefore runs on USB
  Serial/JTAG (`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_USB_SERIAL_JTAG=y` in `sdkconfig.defaults`); a UART0 console
  would clock every log byte into PWR_EN and CS.

## Buttons

| Button | GPIO | `user_config.h` | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| KEY0 | 2 | `BTN_KEY0_PIN` | next page |
| KEY1 | 3 | `BTN_KEY1_PIN` | poll the vault source now |
| KEY2 | 5 | `BTN_KEY2_PIN` | tap → page 1; **held 5 s → reboot into Wi-Fi setup** |
| BOOT | 0 | `BTN_BOOT_PIN` | previous page |

KEY0–2 are the EE04's three side buttons; all are press-to-GND with the internal pull-up enabled.
BOOT is the button on the XIAO module itself — also the bootloader strap pin, so holding it while
pressing RESET enters download mode, which is unrelated to the firmware's use of it.

The long press is detected by *sampling the pin*, not by timing two edges: the driver interrupts on
the press only, so a release generates no event to time against.

## Battery

| Signal | XIAO pad | GPIO | `user_config.h` |
|---|---|---|---|
| BAT_ADC | A0 | 1 | `BATT_ADC_PIN` |
| ADC_EN | D5 | 6 | `BATT_ENABLE_PIN` |

A 1:3 divider on GPIO1 (ADC1_CH0) behind a load switch. **The divider is disconnected — and the
reading meaningless — until GPIO6 is driven HIGH**, which `board_io_init()` does and leaves on. A
reading below 2.5 V is reported as "no cell fitted" rather than as a flat battery: a Li-ion whose
protection circuit has cut off never presents that voltage, so it means USB-only operation, and
showing an empty battery there is a false alarm somebody will chase.

The JST 2.0 battery input also passes a hardware slide switch; it must be ON for battery operation.

## No I2C, no RTC

The EE05 this project forked from routed GPIO5/GPIO6 to an I2C side header. On the **EE04 those
same two pins are KEY2 and the battery divider's enable**, and the board has no RTC of its own. The
I2C bus and the PCF85063A driver are therefore gone entirely, and the clock comes from SNTP alone —
which is also why `CONFIG_OBSIDIAN_TIMEZONE` is the only thing standing between UTC and what the
header shows.

## Unused

No audio codec, SD card, touch controller or backlight — e-Paper has no backlight, and none of the
rest is wired on this build. The EE04's 50-pin FPC connector (for Spectra6 colour panels) is
unpopulated in this configuration.
