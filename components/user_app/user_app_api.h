/*
 * user_app_api.h — thread-safe control bridge for the companion-app HTTP server.
 *
 * The device is normally driven by the physical KEY0/1/2 buttons on the UI
 * task. This bridge lets the STA-mode HTTP server (components/device_api) drive
 * the SAME actions and read a snapshot, without ever touching LVGL or the
 * e-Paper panel directly:
 *
 *   - reads  (user_app_snapshot)  take the app's state lock and copy out plain data.
 *   - writes (page/refresh/url/display_test) validate cheaply, then post a
 *     command onto the app's queue; the UI task applies it via the same code
 *     path as a button press.
 *
 * That single-owner rule matters more on this board than on an LCD: a full
 * refresh of a 648x480 panel takes seconds and cannot be interleaved with
 * another, so exactly one task is allowed to start one.
 *
 * All functions are safe to call from the HTTP server task, and are no-ops
 * (returning false / an empty snapshot) until UserApp_TaskInit has run.
