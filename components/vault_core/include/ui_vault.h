/*
 * ui_vault.h — the whole on-glass UI, for the 648x480 e-Paper panel.
 *
 * Four pages under a shared header and footer:
 *
 *   0 볼트 통계   the four headline counters, a 7-day activity chart, top tags
 *                 and a vault-health block
 *   1 링크 그래프 the highest-degree notes and the links between them
 *   2 에이전트    one row per agent: state, last run, counts, progress, note
 *   3 최근 노트   recently modified notes, and the inbox queue beside them
 *
 * Every setter only mutates widgets. Nothing here talks to the panel: on
 * e-Paper the caller decides when a refresh is worth several seconds of
 * flashing, so the sequence is always
 *
 *     ui_vault_set_*(...);  Lvgl_RenderNow();  epd_refresh_*();
 *
 * Portable: LVGL only, no ESP-IDF. The desktop simulator builds these files
 * verbatim, which is how the layout gets checked against a real 648x480 bitmap
 * before it ever reaches hardware.
