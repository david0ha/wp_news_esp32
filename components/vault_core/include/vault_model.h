/*
 * vault_model.h — everything the board knows about the vault, in one struct.
 *
 * This is the seam of the whole project. `vault_t` is produced by exactly two
 * things — vault_parse.c (from the JSON a PC serves) and vault_mock.c (the
 * built-in demo snapshot) — and consumed by exactly two — the UI pages and the
 * companion-app JSON. Nothing else reads the network payload, so a change to
 * the wire format lands in one file.
 *
 * Every array is fixed-size and every count is clamped by the producer. The
 * struct is therefore ~6 KB, copyable, and safe to snapshot under a mutex and
 * hand to the UI task without any ownership question. That is deliberate: on a
 * device where one task owns the panel and another owns the network, a plain
 * copyable value is worth more than the bytes it wastes.
 *
 * Portable: no LVGL, no ESP-IDF. The host tests build this directly.

 * failing, so a vault with 500 agents still renders its first six. */
